# FilRecipes

This project involves building a basic recipe website where I will apply my recently acquired knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

Completing this project will demonstrate that I have sufficiently exercised my skills to construct a simple website.

## Current trajectory:
- Adding some styles here and there. Putting into practice what I have learned so far from The Odin Project.

## Future updates:
- ~~Navigation bar: Add some distinct fancy features depending on what page you are on.~~
- ~~Layout: Fix layout into a more organized one.~~
- Responsive design: As of now, the website is only good to view on desktops.
- Add more text to this file.

## Update - July 22, 2024
- Revamped website name.
- Created an icon for the title bar.
- Created a logo for the website.
- Changed the hover effect for the grid-items.
- Changed layout of the recipe pages.
- Added a home link when in a recipe page.
- Added a footer to the website.
